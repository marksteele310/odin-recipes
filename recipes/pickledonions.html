    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Pickled Onions are a super easy condiment to make and are a fridge staple. They are great
        on sandwiches, tacos, salads, etc. Basically, whenever you want to add something tangy 
        and sweet, these are your guys. You can use any type of onion, although red onions 
        are certainly the most aestetically pleasing. They can be made in under ten minutes and
        will keep in the fridge for weeks.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            1 medium Onion (red, white, yellow)
        </li>
        <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
        <li>Peppercorns (Black, white, rainbow)</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 cup white vinegar</li>
        <li>1/6 cup cane sugar</li>
        <li>1 tbs kosher salt</li>
        <li>heat-proof mason jar with tight sealing lid</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Using the side of your knife or the palm of your hand, crush the clove of garlic. This 
        will help release the garlic flavor.
    </li>
    <li>Add the garlic, peppercorns, and bay leaf to the bottom of the mason jar.</li>
    <li>Peel and cut the onion through the root. Slice the onion into thin strips. Ulimately, 
        the thickness of the onion is up to you. Don't go too thin as the onions will start to 
        lose their shape during the pickling and storage. A thicker slice will retain more of the
        raw onion flavor.
    </li>
    <li>Add the sliced onions to the mason jar.</li>
    <li>In a pot or saucepan, whisk together the vinegar, sugar, salt, and water over medium 
        heat just until the solids dissolve completely.
    </li>
    <li>Let the mixture cool for 5 minutes</li>
    <li>Once the mixture has cooled, pour it into the mason jar. Be sure to go all the way to the 
        top to completely submerge the onions.
    </li>
    <li>With the lid off, let the onions cool on the countertop. They do not need to be completely 
        cooled, but the outside of the glass should not be hot to the touch.
    </li>
    <li>Place the lid on tightly and store in the fridge.</li>
    <li>You can enjoy these onions after a few hours but they will reach their prime after about
        24 hours.</li>
    </ol>
