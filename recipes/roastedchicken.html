    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Roasted chicken might seem intimiating, but is actually incredibly simple. Not only is
        it a great meal for guests, it is also an economically friendly way to meal prep. You have
        breasts, thighs, wings, and scraps to use throughout the week. You can also make some
        delicious chicken stock the next day!
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Whole roasting chicken (smaller tends to be better, but up to you)</li>
        <li>Unsalted Butter</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Garlic Powder</li>
        <li>1 head of garlic</li>
        <li>A few sprigs of thyme and/or rosemary</li>
        <li>1 lemon</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove the chicken from packaging and pat dry. Season liberally with salt, pepper,
            and garlic powder.
        </li>
        <li>Place the chicken on a wire rack and place in the fridge for 8-24 hours. This
            step will help the seasons permeate the meat and also helps dry out the skin for
            a crispier finished texture.
        </li>
        <li>Remove the chicken from the fridge and stuff the cavity with the lemon (sliced in half)
            , the garlic head chopped so that all the cloves are exposed, and the herbs.
        </li>
        <li>Using kitchen twine (or aluminum foil) tie the hind legs together. This helps
            the chicken cook more evenly.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 425 degree F.</li>
        <li>In a saucepan or microwave, melt the butter.</li>
        <li>Using a basting brush, apply a generous layer of butter to the outside of the chicken.
            The butter should form a "crust" on the skin as it cools.
            Note that this may remove some of the seasoning, so give it a quick sprinkle of salt.
        </li>
        <li>Place the chicken in a cast iron pan, tucking the wings under the body so they don't burn.
        </li>
        <li>Let the chicken roast for 50-60 minutes.</li>
        <li>When done, let the chicken rest in the pan under aluminum foil for 20 minutes before
            serving.
        </li>
    </ol>
