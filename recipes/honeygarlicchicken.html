    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Honey Garlic Chicken is an easy dish that balances sweet and savory. It is a very easy 
        weeknight meal that can be complete in less than 30 minutes. While it contains many 
        ingredients common to Asian cuisine, this dish is much more for an American palate. 
        The chicken is first seared and then caramalized in the honey sauce with onion, garlic, 
        and ginger. The dish is served over white rice and garnished with parsley.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>

        <li>1/2 a white or yellow onion</li>
        <li>5 cloves of garlic (minced)</li>
        <li>1 tsp of freshly grated ginger</li>
        <li>2 tbs finely chopped parsley</li>
        <li>2 tbs rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tbs soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 cup honey</li>
        <li>water (as needed)</li>
        <li>1 Habenero pepper / Sambal Chili Paste / Red Pepper Flakes</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of basmati rice</li>
        <li>1 tbs unsalted butter</li>
        <li>High heat vegetable oil (Canola)</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Black Pepper</li>
        <li>Garlic Powder</li>
        <li>Onion Powder</li>
        <li>Sesame Seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat a wok or heavy bottomed pan over high heat. Do not add oil yet as it
            will likely burn.
        </li>
        <li>Rinse the Rice under cold water to remove any excessive startch. Add the Rice to 
            a pot with 1 cup of water. Place over high heat.
        </li>
        <li>When the water begins to boil, turn heat as low as it will go. 
            Add the butter and a pinch of salt. Cover and let cook for 18 minutes</li>
        <li>Chop the onion into a medium dice. Finely mince the garlic and grate the ginger.
            If using a fresh pepper, dice it very fine. You may remove the seeds to tame the heat.
        </li>
        <li>Cut chicken thighs into bite sized chunks, season liberally with salt, pepper, garlic 
            poweder, and onion powder.
        </li>
        <li>For the sauce, whisk together the honey, soy sauce, and rice vinegar in a bowl. 
            You may choose to add a splash of water to make it easier to combine but note that 
            this will increase the reduction time. You can always add a bit more water later if 
            necessary.
        </li>
        <li>When your pan is hot, add a tbs of oil and add your chicken. The goal is just to get 
            a good sear on the chicken pieces. Avoid over turning/mixing. 
        </li>
        <li>Once you have a golden brown color on the chicken, add the aromatics (garlic, ginger, 
            and pepper). Sautee for 30 seconds.
        </li>
        <li>Add the onion. If you prefer a bite to your onion, simply stir them in and proceed to 
            the next step. Otherwise, sautee for 1-2 minutes to soften the onion.
        </li>
        <li>Pour in the sauce. Give a good stir, being sure to scrape the bottom of the pan. We will
            let this cook down and reduce to a syrupy consistentcy. 
        </li>
        <li>Once the majority of the liquid has evaporated from the sauce and the chicken and 
            veggies are glazed, turn off the heat.
        </li>
        <li>Serve the chicken over the rice and garnish with parsley and sesame seeds</li>
    </ol>
